I wanted a more minimal and simplified mod swapper for Genshin Impact's 3dmigoto, so I created one.

Installation:
You can run from anywhere, but if you put it inside the 3dmigoto main folder it will auto detect folders. 

How it works:
This software actually moves the entire selected mod out to a seperate folder when disabling that will be found here \3dmigoto\disabledMods. Re-enabling moves the mod back to the regular mod folder. I prefer this method to avoid clutter and messing with content of the files.
